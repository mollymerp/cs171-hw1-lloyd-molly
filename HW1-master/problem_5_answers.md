1. What's missing? Is this bar chart usable in its current form?

	This chart is missing text to supplement the visualization. Adding text is essential to understanding a 		visualization in terms of the data being displayed and the methods used to analyze the data. 
2. What is the role of each of the three nested levels of g elements? (keep in mind you'll be adding a title to 	the chart)
	the first <g> element serves as a container for the container of the individual <g> elements.

3. Complete the implementation section below. Is there any consequence if you add the text elements before or 		after the rect elements? Why?
