In order to understand the summary statistics across all states in the US, the data could be displayed in ranked order with the state with highest unemployment displayed first. This would provide a hierarchical view of the data, instead of merely displaying it in alphabetical order by state which adds no information to the presentation of the data. 

Another option could be to have an interactivity feature that allows the user to sort based on different classifications, such as population of the state, percentage of population in the workforce, change in unemployment rate over the past year, etc. This would add informative dimension to the table.
